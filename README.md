CRITICAL SECURITY FINDINGS
1. MAJOR PII EXPOSURE - Profiles Table
Severity: HIGH üö®

Your profiles table has a severe security vulnerability where ALL user email addresses and profile information are publicly visible. The current RLS policy is:

"Users can view all profiles" FOR SELECT USING (true)
This means any authenticated user can access all user emails and personal information from the entire platform - a massive privacy violation and potential GDPR compliance issue.

2. Weak Authentication Configuration
Severity: MEDIUM ‚ö†Ô∏è

The Supabase linter identified:

OTP expiry exceeds recommended threshold - Authentication tokens stay valid too long
Leaked password protection is disabled - No protection against compromised passwords

3. Missing Input Validation on Team Invitations
Severity: MEDIUM ‚ö†Ô∏è

The team invitation system lacks proper validation:

No email format validation before database insertion
No sanitization of invitation messages
No rate limiting on invitation sending
4. Edge Function Email Security
Severity: LOW-MEDIUM ‚ö†Ô∏è

The team invitation edge function constructs HTML emails with user input without proper sanitization, though the risk is limited since it's sent via Supabase's email service.
